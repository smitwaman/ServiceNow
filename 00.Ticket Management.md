Ticket management is a crucial aspect of many business operations, including IT service management, customer support, and project management. Here's a detailed explanation of the procedure and tasks involved in ticket management, focusing on creating, updating, and resolving tickets for various types of issues or requests:

1. **Ticket Creation:**

   a. **Identification of Issue or Request:** The ticket management process begins with the identification of an issue or request by a user, customer, or automated monitoring system. This could be an IT incident, service request, change request, or any other type of issue requiring attention.

   b. **Capture Details:** The person or system reporting the issue provides relevant details such as a description of the problem, any error messages, affected systems or services, and the impact on users or operations.

   c. **Priority and Classification:** The ticket creator may assign a priority level to the ticket based on the urgency and impact of the issue. Additionally, the ticket is classified according to its type (e.g., incident, service request) and category (e.g., network issues, software problems).

   d. **Create Ticket:** Using the ticketing tool, the user or support personnel creates a new ticket by entering the captured details, selecting appropriate attributes (e.g., priority, category), and submitting the ticket for processing.

2. **Ticket Updating:**

   a. **Progress Tracking:** As the ticket moves through the resolution process, it undergoes various updates to track its progress. Updates may include changes in status, assignment to specific individuals or teams, and additional comments or notes.

   b. **Communication:** The ticketing system facilitates communication between stakeholders involved in resolving the issue. Updates and comments are added to the ticket to provide transparency and keep everyone informed about the status and actions taken.

   c. **Attachments and Documentation:** Relevant documentation, screenshots, logs, or files may be attached to the ticket to provide additional context or assist in troubleshooting.

   d. **Escalation:** If the ticket is not progressing as expected or requires urgent attention, it may be escalated to higher-level support personnel or management for intervention.

3. **Ticket Resolution:**

   a. **Investigation and Diagnosis:** The assigned personnel or team investigates the reported issue, gathers relevant information, and diagnoses the root cause of the problem.

   b. **Resolution Plan:** Based on the diagnosis, a plan is formulated to address the issue and restore normal operations. This may involve applying fixes, implementing workarounds, or fulfilling service requests.

   c. **Implementation:** The resolution plan is implemented, which may include making configuration changes, deploying patches or updates, or performing corrective actions.

   d. **Verification:** After implementing the resolution, the ticket is verified to ensure that the reported issue has been effectively resolved and that the desired outcome has been achieved.

   e. **Closure:** Once verified, the ticket is marked as resolved or closed in the ticketing system. Any necessary documentation or follow-up actions are completed, and the ticket is officially closed.

By following this structured process of ticket management, organizations can effectively track, prioritize, and resolve various types of issues and requests, ensuring efficient operations and satisfactory customer experiences
