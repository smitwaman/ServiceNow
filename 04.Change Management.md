Change management in ServiceNow involves managing changes to IT infrastructure, applications, or services in a controlled and systematic manner to minimize disruptions and risks. Here are the detailed steps for change management using the ServiceNow tool:

1. **Access ServiceNow Platform:**
   - Log in to the ServiceNow platform using your credentials.
   - Upon login, navigate to the Change Management module or menu option specifically designated for change management.

2. **Create a New Change Request:**
   - Click on the "New Change" button or link to create a new change request.
   - Provide the necessary details for the change request, including:
     - Summary: A concise summary of the change.
     - Description: Detailed information about the change, including its purpose, scope, and potential impact on IT services.
     - Priority: The urgency and impact level of the change (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
     - Assignment group: The team or group responsible for implementing the change.
     - Category and subcategory: Classify the change based on its type and nature (e.g., Infrastructure, Application, Service).
     - Change type: Specify whether the change is a standard change, emergency change, or normal change.
     - Additional fields: Depending on your organization's configuration, you may need to fill in other fields such as risk assessment, implementation plan, and rollback strategy.

3. **Submit the Change Request:**
   - Once all necessary information is entered, click on the "Submit" or "Create" button to submit the change request for processing.

4. **Change Planning and Assessment:**
   - Upon receiving the change request, the change management team initiates a planning and assessment phase to evaluate the proposed change.
   - The change request is reviewed to assess its impact on IT services, potential risks, and dependencies with other changes or activities.

5. **Change Approval:**
   - Based on the assessment, the change request may undergo an approval process involving various stakeholders, such as change advisory board (CAB) members, IT managers, and business owners.
   - Approvals may be obtained through formal change review meetings, email approvals, or automated workflows configured within ServiceNow.

6. **Change Implementation:**
   - Once approved, the change is scheduled for implementation according to the planned timeline and change window.
   - The change management team coordinates with relevant stakeholders to execute the change, following predefined procedures and best practices.

7. **Monitoring and Review:**
   - During the implementation phase, the change management team monitors the progress of the change and addresses any issues or deviations from the planned activities.
   - Regular checkpoints and status updates are provided to stakeholders to ensure transparency and accountability throughout the change process.

8. **Post-Implementation Review:**
   - After the change is successfully implemented, a post-implementation review (PIR) is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the change and its impact on IT services.
   - Lessons learned from the change implementation are documented, and feedback is collected to improve future change management practices.

9. **Closure and Documentation:**
   - Once the change is verified and validated, the change request is marked as "Completed" or "Closed" in the ServiceNow system.
   - Detailed documentation of the change, including change records, approvals, implementation steps, and PIR findings, is recorded for audit and compliance purposes.

10. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - Change management data and metrics are analyzed to identify opportunities for process optimization, automation, and risk mitigation.
    - Feedback from stakeholders and lessons learned from change implementations are used to enhance change management policies, procedures, and workflows.

By following these detailed steps for change management in ServiceNow, organizations can effectively plan, assess, implement, and review changes to IT infrastructure, applications, and services, ensuring minimal disruptions and maximizing the value of IT investments
